[2.11.2081]  We've been experiencing strange power surges lately on the station. The director reassured me that everthing will run smoothly from now on. The robots have been acting up ever since the last communications blackout though, I'm afraid next time they'll go mad...
Power surges emanating from the hyperspace gates seem to have an unusual effect on machinery, especially the robots on the stations. We've observed some unfortunate violent reactions from the machines recently--this is all starting to get out of control. We long suspected that there was something... else... out there in hyperspace, something that we, perhaps, should never have disturbed... It's time that we sealed up the transport gates for good. The best way, would be to disable the transit network's central hub, on the lunar surface...

Choose a target:
No road map? No problem! The hyperspace gate network calculates a path to your destination by routing your journey through a sequence of waypoints. Tens of thousands of waypoints were contructed in orbit around Earth and its moon. Because the waypoints are constantly in motion during orbit, the gate network continually recalculates the path to your destination. You'll never visit the same waypoints twice! Due to the unpredictable nature of the hyperspace gates, passing through a gate is sometimes referred to as a blind jump.
