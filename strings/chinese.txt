Oh, that old thing? Eh, I have no use for it.
A turbo charger for a blaster, heh, quite destructive at close range.
I'm not so sure what this thing does, it looks like an old pocket watch. Very fine metalwork though, worth a lot of money...
Looks like a piece of surveying equipment. These map system devices will build a map as you walk, and point you in the direction of the nearest hyperspace gate.
Ack! Be careful with those! Those shells are highly unstable!!!
A fancy radio transmitter, try using it near some machines.
An orange! Legend has it that the workers who built these waypoints were out here for months at a time... wouldn't want to get scurvy!
A portable hyperspace gate generator... think of it as... a sort of insurance policy if you're knocked out.

Choose a target:
No road map? No problem! The hyperspace gate network calculates a path to your destination by routing your journey through a sequence of waypoints. Tens of thousands of waypoints were contructed in orbit around Earth and its moon. Because the waypoints are constantly in motion during orbit, the gate network continually recalculates the path to your destination. You'll never visit the same waypoints twice! Due to the unpredictable nature of the hyperspace gates, passing through a gate is sometimes referred to as a blind jump.

"This memorial to those who perished during the calamity. The waypoints in this area were overrun by the machines, and sealed off. Date--5.3.2081."
Wow, that was 100 years ago...
Your ship...
[2.11.2081]  We've been experiencing strange power surges lately on the station, but the director reassured me that everthing will run smoothly from now on. The robots have been acting up ever since the last communications blackout though, I'm afraid next time they'll go mad...
[3.7.2081]  I was lucky to be on some of the near-earth waypoints when the robots turned on us... a lot of people aparantly weren't so fortunate. To escape the machines, I fled through the warp gates, but the carnage seems to be even worse the further I go. Some of the stations out here seem to have been more populated, unfortunately.
Power surges emanating from the hyperspace gates seem to have an unusual effect on machinery, especially the robots on the stations. We've observed some unfortunate violent reactions from the machines recently--this is all starting to get out of control. During the last power surge, I thought that I glimpsed the sillouette of a large, cloaked figure through the veil of the jump gate. We long suspected that there was something... else... out there in hyperspace, something that we, perhaps, should never have disturbed by opening these gates...
The power surges from the jump gates are more-or-less constant now, and we've lost control of everything. I sent word back to Earth, that someone needs to be sent out here, to deal the causes of these fluctuations... they're dealing with their own mechanized revolt, though, so I'm not sure how soon they'll send a  soldier. In the meantime, I've invented a signal jamming device, which seems to render the machines immune to the power surges...
